This is the final project from the 2023 Complete Web Developer course on Zero to Mastery Academy. This is a full-stack application that implements 
<ul>
  <li1>HTML</li1>
  <li1>CSS</li1>
  <li1>React</li1>
  <li1>Javascript</li1>
  <li1>Node.js</li1>
  <li1>PostgreSQL</li1>
</ul>
The app has a login, registration, and face-detection API feature. The user is able to register their information that can be stored on a database. The user uploads a URL for an image and a face-detection API is utilized to produce a face-detecting box on the image. A counter records the amount of image uploads a user performs. The user can sign out of the application and can sign in again with their email and password.
